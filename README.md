Automatically count kills of monsters needed to summon the S Ranks (including kills of others)

Nunyu gets a timer ... so accurate that you literally have a countdown until it spawns right to the second if you witnessed a fate failing while in the zone, else it just starts counting back from 1 hour and will spawn before the timer runs out! (failed fates reset the timer including the ones you don't start up). Since the time is based on zone data, it won't fail you and reach 0 if Nunyu is spawnable!

Salt and Light has a discard counter!

Fate counters for the zones that require a certain number of fates to pop (The Dravanian forelands aka Cerf's Up)!

Counts the gathering attempts you make on nodes in the zone. Not the amount you collect, the amount of strikes which is what the S Rank spawn condition requires.

Reminds you in each zone what the spawn conditions are!

Also, the kill counts will stay stored until you press the reset button in that instance (only that instance gets reset so you preserve the data for other S Ranks conditions).

I am thinking of having this integrate with Faloop later to not even show the window if the window is closed and give you the option of an in game window of spawnable S Ranks with their percentages since I now know there is a way to access the faloop API.
